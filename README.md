# BLK360 laser scanning of rainforests

   --------------------------  
   
**In 2019, a permanent 12-ha rainforest plot in East Amazonia, called “Petit Plateau”, was scanned using two BLK360 laser scanners.** <br/>

**A new algorithm was then developed for detecting tree stems and for extracting ground points from the laser scanning data. 36,422 stems were detected, of which 29,665 (81%) were in the 3-10 cm DBH range.** <br/>
